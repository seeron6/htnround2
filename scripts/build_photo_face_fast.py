"""build_photo_face.py with scripts/pipeline_accel.py installed. Same arguments, same outputs.

The stages, their order and every result file are build_photo_face.run()'s own.
Only two things differ: slow leaf functions are replaced by exact equivalents,
and the independent AI calls are started together instead of one after another.
CONTACT_PREFETCH=0 keeps the AI calls serial; CONTACT_SERIAL_PIPELINE=1 (read by
face_pipeline.py) bypasses this launcher entirely. See PIPELINE_SPEEDUP.md.
